Slide 1:
Mary was stuck. As a manager of a regional grocery chain, she had been struggling for months to fill key positions. No matter how many job ads she posted, they weren't getting results.
The stores were understaffed, her team was stretched thin, and morale was slipping.

Slide 2:
Then, Mary had an idea: what if the entire team got involved? Instead of trying to deal with hiring alone, she turned it into a team effort.

Slide 3:
She gathered everyone together, explained the challenge, and opened the floor for ideas. What happened next was incredible.

Slide 4:
The maintenance crew put up hiring flyers around town. Sarah, a cashier, started spreading the word at school drop-offs and sports events. Team members invited friends and family to shadow them for a day.
And suddenly, people wanted to join.

Slide 5:
Within weeks, the store had filled its vacant positions. Even better, they had a list of people ready to join the team in the future.
And the biggest win was that the team felt like they weren't just showing up for work, they were making a real difference.
